# Example scripts for the usage of pyVPRM
This repository contains a collection of example scripts for the usage of ```pyVPRM``` which can be installed from here 
```https://github.com/tglauch/pyVPRM/blob/main/README.md```

Currently only the scripts in ```./wrf_preprocessor``` and ```./vprm_predictions``` can be directly executed. Example files for running the VPRM fit, will be included soon.
