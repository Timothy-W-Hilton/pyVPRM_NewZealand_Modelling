# Example scripts
This repository contains a collection of example scripts for the usage of ```pyVPRM``` which can be installed from here 
```https://github.com/tglauch/pyVPRM/blob/main/README.md```

Currently only the scripts in ```./wrf_preprocessor``` and ```./vprm_predictions``` can be directly executed. Example files for running the VPRM fit, will be included soon. More information can be found in the README in the respective folders and the comments in the scripts. 

Note: The example scripts come with a set of example data files. Hence the download of the repository requires around 100MB. The data have been only marginally pre-processed to limit the amount of memory required.
